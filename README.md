# About

QobuzDownloaderX-MOD is a program for downloading music streams from the streaming platform [Qobuz](https://qobuz.com).

You can not download anything with a free account.

This Modded version of the original QobuzDownloaderX was created for educational purposes.  
Some changes include:  

- Isolated Qobuz API interaction to a separate library project [QobuzApiSharp](https://github.com/DJDoubleD/QobuzApiSharp).
- Complete refactoring of backend code (in an attempt to simplify and optimize).
- Added completely revamped search function.

See release notes in [releases](../../releases) section for full overview of all fixes and changes.
