# This is a fork of [QobuzDownloaderX](https://github.com/ImAiiR/QobuzDownloaderX). 

Initially fixed login problems due to several updates to Qobuz Web Player bundle.js but evolved into a full blown rework of the code for educational purposes.  
Refactored code to drastically reduce duplicate code and isolated Qobuz API interaction in a separate library project [QobuzApiSharp](https://github.com/DJDoubleD/QobuzApiSharp).  
Added some bugfixes and completely revamped search function.  
Content below is from the original projects README.
